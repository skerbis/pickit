## Motivation

Almost every large SPA or project involves date and time input. Browser's native implementations are inconsistent and limited in functionality. Most other libraries require you to pull in heavy dependencies like jQuery, Bootstrap, and moment.js. Additionally, many pickers lack proper accessibility support.

Pickit aims to be:
- ✨ **Beautiful** out of the box
- 🚀 **Dependency-free** (no bloated bundles)
- ♿ **Fully accessible** (WCAG 2.1 AA+)
- 💪 **Powerful** and extensible
- 📦 **Lightweight** (fraction of the size of other libraries)
- 🎨 **Multi-purpose** (dates, times, and colors)

## Feature Overview

- Dependency-free (no bloated bundles)
- Simple, polished UX
- **Date + time picker** with full accessibility
- **Color picker** with keyboard navigation
- Range selections
- Ability to select multiple dates
- Can be used as just a time picker
- Display dates in a human-friendly format
- Easily disable specific dates, date ranges, or any date using arbitrary logic
- Week numbers
- 51 locales
- 10 beautiful themes (incl. dark, material, UIKit, and glassmorphism)
- Numerous plugins
- Libraries available for React, Angular, Vue, Ember, and more

## Documentation & Demos

Full documentation: https://flatpickr.js.org (flatpickr docs - Pickit maintains API compatibility)

## Compatibility

IE9 and up, Edge, iOS Safari 6+, Chrome 8+, Firefox 6+

### Browser-Specific Enhancements

Pickit includes specific fixes and optimizations for various browsers:

- **Safari**: Enhanced select dropdown rendering with proper padding and appearance fixes
- **Cross-browser**: Consistent styling across all modern browsers with vendor prefixes
- **Mobile**: Touch-optimized interactions for iOS and Android

## Legacy Accessibility (from flatpickr)

flatpickr was already designed with accessibility in mind. Pickit builds upon this foundation:

### ARIA Attributes

All interactive elements include proper ARIA roles and labels:

- **Calendar container**: `role="dialog"` with localized `aria-label`
- **Navigation buttons**: `role="button"` with localized previous/next month labels
- **Date cells**: Individual `aria-label` for each day with formatted date
- **Form inputs**: Year, month, hour, and minute inputs with descriptive labels
- **Plugins**: confirmDate and monthSelect plugins include full ARIA support

### Keyboard Navigation

- **Tab**: Navigate between interactive elements
- **Enter/Space**: Activate buttons and select dates
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate between days in the calendar
- **Ctrl + Arrow Left/Right**: Change month
- **Ctrl + Arrow Up/Down**: Change year
- **Escape**: Close the calendar

### Localized ARIA Labels

All ARIA labels are fully localizable. Complete translations available in:

- **English** (default)
- **German** (Deutsch)
- **French** (Français)
- **Spanish** (Español)
- **Italian** (Italiano)
- **Dutch** (Nederlands)
- **Portuguese** (Português)
- **Russian** (Русский)
- **Japanese** (日本語)
- **Chinese** (中文)
- ...and 41+ other languages ready to be extended

**English:**
- Date picker: "Date picker"
- Previous month: "Previous month"
- Next month: "Next month"
- Confirm: "Confirm date selection"
- Year: "Year"
- Month: "Month"

**German:**
- Date picker: "Datumsauswahl"
- Previous month: "Vorheriger Monat"
- Next month: "Nächster Monat"
- Confirm: "Datumswahl bestätigen"
- Year: "Jahr"
- Month: "Monat"

**French:**
- Date picker: "Sélecteur de date"
- Previous month: "Mois précédent"
- Next month: "Mois suivant"
- Confirm: "Confirmer la sélection de date"

To use a localized version, simply set the locale:

```javascript
import pickit from "pickit";
import { German } from "pickit/dist/l10n/de.js";

pickit("#myDatePicker", {
  locale: German
});
```

All ARIA labels will automatically use the selected locale.

## Building & Development

For information about building Pickit from source and contributing, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## Migration from flatpickr

Pickit maintains 100% API compatibility with flatpickr. Simply replace:

```javascript
// Old
import flatpickr from "flatpickr";
flatpickr("#myInput");

// New
import pickit from "pickit";
pickit("#myInput");
```

All options, methods, and hooks remain the same. Your existing flatpickr code will work without modifications.
