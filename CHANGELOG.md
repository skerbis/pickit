### ✨ Added - Accessibility Enhancements (Date/Time Picker)

#### ARIA Improvements
- **Grid Structure**: Added proper `role="grid"` to calendar container with `role="row"` and `role="gridcell"` for semantic table structure
- **State Management**: 
  - `aria-expanded="true/false"` on calendar container to indicate open/closed state
  - `aria-selected="true"` on selected date cells
  - `aria-disabled="true"` on disabled date cells (in addition to CSS class)
- **Live Regions**: Added `aria-live="polite"` region for screen reader announcements
  - Month/year change announcements
  - Date selection feedback
  - Range selection updates
- **Time Picker**: Enhanced with `role="spinbutton"`, `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`, and `aria-valuenow`

#### Keyboard Navigation
- **Home/End Keys**: Jump to first/last day of current month
- **Page Up/Down**: Navigate by month (forward/backward)
- **Shift + Page Up/Down**: Navigate by year (forward/backward)
- **Tab/Shift+Tab**: Improved focus order through all interactive elements
- **'t' Key**: Quick jump to today's date (when calendar is open)
- **Focus Trap**: Implemented proper focus trap in modal mode
- **Focus Persistence**: Maintained focus position during month/year changes

#### Locale Enhancements

  - `weekdayAriaLabel`: Screen reader text for weekday headers
  - `calendarAriaLabel`: Overall calendar description
  - `gridAriaLabel`: Grid structure description
  - `rangeStartAriaLabel`: Range selection start announcement
  - `rangeEndAriaLabel`: Range selection end announcement
  - `todayAriaLabel`: Today's date identifier

#### Visual & UX Improvements
- **Focus Indicators**: Enhanced visible focus styles for better keyboard navigation visibility
- **Reduced Motion**: Added `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` support
  - Disables all animations and transitions
  - Respects user's system preferences
- **High Contrast**: Added `@media (prefers-contrast: high)` support
